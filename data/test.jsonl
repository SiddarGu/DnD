Effort looks around briefly, but it's more for the ambience of a Gorta tavern than to try and notice anything. It's been a long time. Maybe too long. Maybe not long enough.

They sit semi-circle around a table as strangers come up, sit for a moment, and then leave. Some pass the half-orcs parchment, or little sacks. Some only speak briefly. A few tables in, a strange assortment of humanoids play dice. They're rowdy, but not enough to get thrown out. They seem to be spending enough on ale, anyway. On the other side of the large bar, a single tiefling sits. You watch as the person sitting next to them passes them a small coin purse under the bar. The tiefling quickly passes them a vial, and the person leaves. As Brask approaches the table, the half-orcs look up, questioning an unknown face. In response, the middle half-orc snorts and looks back down at some kind of ledger. One of the others speaks up. \" What you can do for fun is get the hell out of here if you know what's good for you. \" Another snorts out a laugh, and swallows the rest of his ale in one gulp. Across the bar, the tiefling pushes his mug around, not really drinking much. Effort, you don't know him - he's relatively young. Probably just old enough to be sitting in this tavern without being questioned too much. His clothes aren't dirty, but they're ragged. Pants torn around the ankles with worn-out knees.

Your mission is to disrupt the trade routes along the Sword Coast by attacking any and all merchant caravans you can find. Remember not to concentrate your activities within a single area! We want the great cities of the region on edge and jumping at shadows. If they are kept busy trying to find your mercenaries, they will be unable to investigate our activities until it is too late. Once we succeed, we will honor the second part of our bargain and use The Chill as the foundation for a new standing army of the Cult. \"Once you check the map provided for you, you will find that the caches containing the other parts of your payment will be found throughout the Greypeak Mountains -- from their foothills to their very peaks. This was done for two reasons. Firstly, whether you like it or not Captain Dar, you will now be forced to keep your forces on the move -- at least if you want to keep getting paid! Secondly, use the coin we provide to recruit from the hobgoblin, goblin, and bugbear tribes that live in the Greypeak Mountains. Remember that, per our contract, any treasure you take from the caravans belongs to The Chill. The larger an army you field, the more plunder you will be able to acquire.\" The Herr Doktor Professor ignores the message from the orb, however.

Asher, you've heard of the Sea Witch, a pirate ship that has attacked peaceful trading ships up and down the Sword Coast and sometimes further afield. You've heard tavern tales, but can't recall any of the specific details; you remember that the stories sounded rather implausible when the bards told them. The rider spares your group only a passing glance, and doesn't appear interested in you at all; they continue on their journey south. On the approach, Dario sees clearly that one of the deer is larger than the others, and will provide a fine meal. He takes aim and releases the arrow, and it hits the deer in the head, killing it instantly. The other animals take flight right away, and are too fast and nimble for a second shot. Dario is able to collect the deer and recover his arrow, too.", "target": "perception"}

The tiefling quickly passes them a vial, and the person leaves. As Brask approaches the table, the half-orcs look up, questioning an unknown face. In response, the middle half-orc snorts and looks back down at some kind of ledger. One of the others speaks up. \" What you can do for fun is get the hell out of here if you know what's good for you. \" Another snorts out a laugh, and swallows the rest of his ale in one gulp. Across the bar, the tiefling pushes his mug around, not really drinking much. Effort, you don't know him - he's relatively young.

Is Varinth going to wear the armour and take the penalties, or try something else? I do need Stealth rolls from Strix and Scupper as they follow along the roofs. You definitely get the sense that you are not the first to follow these paths, as there are plenty of places where objects have been stowed, or handholds carved, to allow people to move around easily. Who is responsible for that, you do not know. Lackley and his team are not very chatty, but they're not hostile to you either. One of them attempts to make conversation with Varinth: Hope Amkall didn't give you too much trouble about the hair. My mate got told to dye his.

Searching the dead half orc you find something a bit more interesting. Grannoc has a map scrawled on the torn-off flap of a leather satchel. It shows Neverwinter Wood and marks the location of a place called theCircle of Thunder. The orc that you have kept alive stares you down and refuses to answer any questions despite your threats. Again the orc squeals, \" Around the house and at the circle! Did you not see them? I know of no other orcs, you killed all of them! Don't kill me!
