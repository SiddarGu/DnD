Effort looks around briefly, but it's more for the ambience of a Gorta tavern than to try and notice anything. It's been a long time. Maybe too long. Maybe not long enough.

They sit semi-circle around a table as strangers come up, sit for a moment, and then leave. Some pass the half-orcs parchment, or little sacks. Some only speak briefly. A few tables in, a strange assortment of humanoids play dice. They're rowdy, but not enough to get thrown out. They seem to be spending enough on ale, anyway. On the other side of the large bar, a single tiefling sits. You watch as the person sitting next to them passes them a small coin purse under the bar. The tiefling quickly passes them a vial, and the person leaves. As Brask approaches the table, the half-orcs look up, questioning an unknown face. In response, the middle half-orc snorts and looks back down at some kind of ledger. One of the others speaks up. \" What you can do for fun is get the hell out of here if you know what's good for you. \" Another snorts out a laugh, and swallows the rest of his ale in one gulp. Across the bar, the tiefling pushes his mug around, not really drinking much. Effort, you don't know him - he's relatively young. Probably just old enough to be sitting in this tavern without being questioned too much. His clothes aren't dirty, but they're ragged. Pants torn around the ankles with worn-out knees.
