Each stone is stamped with a small quarter moon or starburst symbol, again referencing Corellon. As well as being the creator of the elves, Corellon is also the god of craft and other such skills. This suggests that the acolytes of this temple probably built everything here themselves. Honestly, 18 is high enough for this one, but good call. Also, I've tried PMing MysPost, but I've heard nothing back. Wondering if their internet's out again or something else. Ruggero: You hear typical sounds of the outdoors. There are a few birds chirping, but really nothing else. However, close inspection of the door reveals small holes just under the threshold of the door from the outside. You can make out the faint glint of arrowheads inside. It appears that whoever these followers of Corellon were, they did not want to be disturbed. They have clearly set traps around the area. Thankfully, your knowledge of structures and buildings has helped you realize that this trap only triggers when the door is opened from the outside.

In the morning, you rise before the sun (before the normal sun that is) and eat breakfast outside the tavern in the light of the Companion. You have all received a package from Teresa and/or Ontharr, containing whatever mundane armour and bland travelling clothes you agreed, and you all look remarkably uninteresting as you eat your fruit and bread. Ontharr reassured you that he will contact Kaerus and arrange for your new armour to be sent to you. Binden leads you down to a small dock not far from the city gate, and you are introduced to Jamel Corm, the captain of the riverboat 'Merry Stoat', who will ferry you to Baldur's Gate. She's a middle-aged gnome who seems unused to taking travellers rather than trade goods, but she welcomes you and you settle in on the boat as she pushes off. (OOC: In terms of your mission, that's almost it. You'll be in the same caravan as the cultists, and your task is to keep an eye on them. But not to get too close or try to infiltrate them - that probably won't work and will be risky for Jalt and Soar in particular as they might be recognised.)", "target": "persuasion"}

From the smaller carvings, after Neya has pointed out, Utar can see several small holes in each one that definitely serve as the source of the gas.

It makes sense; the people came without resistance, so the spoils can be loaded up methodically. The homes are left as they were, not torched, not even ransacked.

This was done for two reasons. Firstly, whether you like it or not Captain Dar, you will now be forced to keep your forces on the move -- at least if you want to keep getting paid! Secondly, use the coin we provide to recruit from the hobgoblin, goblin, and bugbear tribes that live in the Greypeak Mountains.
